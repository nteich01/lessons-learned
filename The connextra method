Agile software development can be made more effective by the use of the connextra method. 
The method involves user stories, which capture what the user does or needs to do when s/he uses the system.
They define the functions a system must provide, capturing the who, what, and why of a requirement in a concise way.
The connextra method usually consists of three parts: 
"As a _____" (identifies the type of user we are referring to, which could be an administrator, an end user, or other)
"I want to _____" (identifies the end goal of the user)
"So that _____" (identifies the benefit which the user will get once the action has been carried out)

Some benefits of the connextra method are that it is very brief and allows for the breaking up of a project into small increments.
Limitations are that user stories are really only conversation starters; they can be vague, informal, or incomplete.
