Takes charge of his or her own career, and isn't afraid to admitã€€ignorance or error.
Early adopter, having instinct for technologies and techniques
Inquisitive and tend to ask questions to gather facts
Critical thinker and rarely take things as given
Realistic and try to understand nature of each problem
