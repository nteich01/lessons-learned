These are the five things I learned as a takeaway to identify a good programmer.
Good programmer is a person who (is),,,
1.Takes charge of his or her own career, and isn't afraid to admit ignorance or error
2.Early adopter, having instinct for technologies and techniques
3.Inquisitive and tend to ask questions to gather facts
4.Critical thinker and rarely take things as given
5.Realistic and try to understand nature of each problem 

I think the first one would be the most important for me, since this characteristic is essential when doing business together.
I would identify that characteristic in the interview,
by asking a time when he/she confronted a error and how he/she responded to that.
