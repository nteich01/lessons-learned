One of the key strategies I took away from the class is the benefits in developing in small stages / pieces while following the "stone soup" methodology.  
If you give developers a monumental project with just one end goal in mind, the development process can take longer.
Teams will guard resources more closely, complicate processes, etc. and the team may fall subject to start-up fatigue.
In order to avoid this, you can develop in stages by introducing one feature (i.e., one stone) at a time to slowly build out a full platform.
As the project gains momentum, the team will find it easier to join ongoing success and rally around the continued development process.
At the same time, its important to balance this with the negative side of parsing out projects into stages that are too small or insignificant.
This could potentially lead to systems drifting further away from the original intent as new patches get added over time.
