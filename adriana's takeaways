+ Keep projects as lean and inexpensive as possible
  1. Don't build it unless you have to, for example often it is best to "buy"/outsource certain services to a specialized 3rd party, such as a Shopify, when they are outside of your competitive core
  2. Avoid using contractors that provide low upfront quotes and a single long development cycle. Though this might initially seem like the least expensive route, fees for change requests and additonal features combined an inflexibility/nonresponsive process will lead to greater costs in the long run and more lost time
  3. Focus on shipping really good projects quickly rather than waiting for projects to be perfect; doing so will not only allow you to get to market quickly, but will also give the ability to incorporate user feedback into future releases
  4. There are significant differences in the costs and benefits of launching your product as an app vs a (mobile optimized or mobile-first) website. In many cases, the website is the better solution for a lean "1.0 launch" as a site costs significantly less to build and can be launched almost immediately. Although apps can provide a more customized and curated user experience, it's probably wisest to validate your core assumptions and user demand via a registration site or email newsletter before embarking on an app build.
